## About Me

I am a second-year M.S. student in the Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology (BJUT). Currently I am a member of Beijing Key Laboratory of Multimedia and Intelligent Software Technology under the supervision of Prof. Yanfeng Sun and Prof. Yongli Hu.

Prior to that, I got my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the School of Electronic Science and Control Engineering, University of Emergency Management, in 2019. In addition, I also studied Geology for a period of time.

Now, my research interests include Graph Neural Network and Intelligent Transportation.

In my daily life, I like to play badminton and swimming.
